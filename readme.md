# Random Quote Machine

We're going to use JavaScript to make a webpage that displays a random quote. We'll use the built-in `fetch` method to call an API that will give us quotes.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Setup your HTML page, and don't forget to include links to the CSS and JS files!
* Be creative in your choice of styling. Think about all of those different CSS properties.

## Gathering Quotes

Your instructor will provide an appropriate API. Stay tuned!

## Requirements

* Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a webpage that displays a random quote on the page when a button is clicked
* Every time the button is clicked, clear the old quote and replace it with a new random quote.
* Use the `fetch` function to obtain a quote from your chosen API.

## Bonus!

* Use the [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). 
  * Note that this requires you to send something in the request header!
  * Take a look at the [docs](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and see if you can figure it out!
  * This API also allows you to use images! If you implement this, how will it change your code?
