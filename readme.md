# Random Quote Machine

We're going to use JavaScript to make a webpage that displays a random quote. We'll use the built-in `fetch` method to call an API that will give us quotes. An API means "Application Program Interface", but in web programmer vernacular, it typically means a 3rd party website that gives us some sort of data.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  * This will reload your code every time you save. How convenient!
  * You need this. See note below.
* Setup your HTML page, and don't forget to include links to the CSS and JS files!
* Be creative in your choice of styling. Think about all of those different CSS properties.

> Note: BrowserSync runs a local server on your machine - this means your code will be running on `http://localhost` instead of directly from the file itself.

## Gathering Quotes

Your instructor will provide an appropriate API. Stay tuned!

## Requirements

* Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a webpage that displays a random quote on the page when a button is clicked
* Every time the button is clicked, clear the old quote and replace it with a new random quote.
* Use the `fetch` function to obtain a quote from your chosen API.

## Bonus!

* Use the [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). 
  * Note that this requires you to send something in the request header!
  * Take a look at the [docs](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and see if you can figure it out!
  * This API also allows you to use images! If you implement this, how will it change your code?
